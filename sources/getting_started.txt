Introduction
------------
The Loopy SDK provides a simple set of classes and methods built upon the Loopy REST API.

App developers can elect to use either the pre-defined user interface controls provided in the Loopy UI 
framework, or "roll their own" using direct SDK calls.

All calls to the Loopy SDK are *asynchronous*, meaning that your application will not "block" while 
waiting for a response from the Loopy server.

.. note:: * iOS 6.1 is the minimum version supported by this SDK

Installing the SDK
------------------

If you are upgrading from a previous release, check out the `Upgrading Guide`_.

    .. _Upgrading Guide: upgrading.html

The Loopy SDK is easily installed with CocoaPods.

Installing With CocoaPods
-------------------------

CocoaPods is an easy, elegant way to manage library dependencies in iOS. No need to manually import frameworks or deal with compiler flags. After a one-time installation of RubyGems (CocoaPods is Ruby-based), a single command-line operation is all that's needed to install or upgrade Loopy. For more information on CocoaPods, check out the `CocoaPods homepage`_.

  .. _CocoaPods homepage: http://cocoapods.org/

 
Step 1: Install RubyGems & CocoaPods (One-Time Operation)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Current Macs come preinstalled with Ruby 1.8.7. For the purposes of CocoaPods, **this is the correct version.** However, you may still need to install RubyGems as directed from the `installation page`_.
 

  .. _installation page: https://rubygems.org/pages/download
 

- Verify that you have both Ruby and RubyGems installed by entering the following in the command line:

::

            $ ruby -v
            ruby 1.8.7 (2012-02-08 patchlevel 358) [universal-darwin12.0]
            $ gem -v
            2.1.5
 
- Install CocoaPods by entering the following in the command line:

::

           $ sudo gem install cocoapods
           $ pod setup
 
 
.. note:: Installing RubyGems and/or CocoaPods can take up to a minute, and may appear unresponsive for brief periods during install.
 

Step 2: Install Loopy as a CocoaPod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- In the root directory of your project, create a Podfile. This file (named "Podfile" with no extension) specifies which CocoaPods will be included in your project. **Your Podfile should contain the following:**

::

            platform :ios
            pod 'Loopy'
 

.. image:: images/podfile_in_directory.png
            :width: 558
            :height: 189
 

- In the command line at the root directory of your project, enter the following:

::

            $ pod install

- After Loopy CocoaPod is created in your project, **you must use the Xcode workspace (YourProject.xcworkspace) to use the CocoaPod.** All your project settings should still be available to you from the workspace. **DO NOT open the .xcodeproj directly.**
