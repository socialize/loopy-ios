    If your app has content that does not live on the web (i.e. it does not have URL)
    you can still allow your users to share this content using a non-URL share.

    When the share occurs we will create a webpage for you that renders the content you
    include in the share item.

    Non-URL components of the share item correspond to |og| tags automatically added
    to the page we create so that post to social networks like Facebook render with the correct
    text and images you intend.

    .. note::

        |br| You can also use the **Item** described below even if you *do* have a URL to add more meaning to your analytics
