Introduction
------------
The Loopy SDK provides a simple set of classes and methods built upon the Loopy REST API.

App developers can elect to use either the pre-defined user interface controls provided in the Loopy UI 
framework, or "roll their own" using direct SDK calls.

All calls to the Loopy SDK are *asynchronous*, meaning that your application will not "block" while 
waiting for a response from the Loopy server.

.. note:: * iOS 6.0 is the minimum version supported by this SDK
